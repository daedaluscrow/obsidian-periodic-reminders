# Obsidian Periodic Reminders

This simple plugins adds large modal reminders that pop up at a user-defined interval. The content of the reminders is taken from a list provided in the settings, and it randomizes the list prior to beginning the interval.

I use this plugin for when I am running a TTRPG game. The popups are intended to remind me to do things I often forget, like give out inspiration or prompt players to describe details about the scene.

Install the app by the normal method (clone this repo into the .obsidian/plugins/ folder in your vault and then find it in the Obsidian settings and enable it). Once installed, the plugin exposes some settings. The first is a switch that turns the reminders on and off. The second is a slider for how many minutes between popups (up to 1 hour). The final setting is the list of reminders you want to be displayed. Each item in this list needs to be separated by a line break.
